# Dubins-Path
Dubins path typically refers to the shortest curve that connects two points in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane (i.e. x-y plane) with a constraint on the curvature of the path and with prescribed initial and terminal tangents to the path, and an assumption that the vehicle traveling the path can only travel forward. If the vehicle can also travel in reverse, then the path follows the Reedsâ€“Shepp curve.

This repository provides a C++ implementation of the Dubins Path algorithm with an OpenGL Based Visualizer. Update on usage is coming soon. But code is fairly straightforward.
